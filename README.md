# Linear_Regression_Project

This project implements a machine learning model, specifically a linear regression algorithm, to predict insurance charges based on various parameters. The dataset used for this project is sourced from an insurance company and encompasses features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

The workflow involves several key steps:

1)Data Loading: Utilizing the Python library pandas, the dataset is imported and stored for analysis.

2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Thorough examination of the dataset is conducted to gain insights into its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.

3)Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned to ensure its integrity and reliability. This includes handling null, missing, and duplicate values, as well as identifying and removing outliers.

4)Feature Engineering: The relevant features are selected and transformed as necessary to prepare the data for modeling.

5)Model Development: A linear regression model is trained using the processed dataset to predict insurance charges based on the input parameters.

6)Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is assessed using appropriate metrics, with a particular focus on accuracy. The model achieves an accuracy rate exceeding 85%, indicating its efficacy in predicting insurance charges.

This project serves as a demonstration of utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to provide valuable insights for insurance companies. By accurately predicting charges based on customer attributes, this model can assist in optimizing pricing strategies and improving decision-making processes within the insurance industry.
